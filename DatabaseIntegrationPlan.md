# Flight Search Application - Database Enhancement Plan

## 1. Security Implementation

### 1.1 Spring Security Configuration
- Extend the existing `SecurityConfig` class to provide authentication for database endpoints
- Implement JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication for stateless API security
- Create security filters for request validation
#### 1.1 Completed with the following:
I'll implement phase 1.1 of the plan - Spring Security Configuration for database endpoints with JWT authentication. Let's first examine the existing SecurityConfig class to understand what we're working with before making changes.I've examined the existing security configuration in your project. The current `SecurityConfig` class is basic, with CORS configuration and stateless session management, but it allows all requests to `/api/**` endpoints without authentication. Let's now implement the JWT authentication for database endpoints.

I've successfully implemented phase 1.1 of the plan - Spring Security Configuration with JWT authentication for database endpoints. Let me summarize what I've added:

1. **JWT Support Dependencies**: Added the necessary JJWT libraries to the project to enable JWT token handling.

2. **JWT Properties Configuration**: Created `JwtProperties.java` to manage all JWT-related settings like token expiration time and secret key.

3. **JWT Token Utility**: Implemented `JwtTokenUtil.java` with methods for token generation, validation, and authentication extraction.

4. **JWT Authentication Filter**: Created `JwtAuthenticationFilter.java` that intercepts every request, validates JWT tokens in the Authorization header, and sets authentication in the security context when valid.

5. **Custom Authentication Entry Point**: Implemented `JwtAuthenticationEntryPoint.java` to return proper JSON responses when authentication fails.

6. **User Details Service**: Added `CustomUserDetailsService.java` to load user details from the database for authentication.

7. **Authentication Controller**: Created `AuthController.java` with a login endpoint that authenticates users and issues JWT tokens.

8. **Enhanced Security Configuration**: Updated SecurityConfig.java to:
   - Integrate the JWT components
   - Configure stateless session management
   - Define access rules for different endpoints:
     - Public endpoints that don't require authentication (flights API, login)
     - Protected database endpoints requiring authentication (users, flight searches, etc.)
     - Admin-only endpoints
   - Add JWT authentication filter to the filter chain
   - Configure CORS for cross-origin requests

This implementation ensures that your database endpoints are properly secured, requiring valid JWT authentication tokens before allowing access, while keeping the existing flight search API publicly accessible.

To use this authentication system:

1. Users will first call `/api/auth/login` with their credentials
2. They'll receive a JWT token in response
3. For subsequent requests to protected endpoints, they must include the token in the Authorization header as `Bearer {token}`

This completes phase 1.1 of the security implementation plan. The next phases would involve implementing user registration, enhancing authorization with roles, and adding CSRF protection, but they were not part of this specific implementation task.

### 1.2 User Authentication
- Develop a `UserDetailsService` implementation for database-backed authentication
- Create authentication endpoints (login, logout, register)
- Implement password encryption using BCrypt
- Add remember-me functionality

### 1.3 Authorization
- Configure role-based access control (User, Admin roles)
- Secure endpoints using method-level security annotations
- Implement URL-based authorization rules

### 1.4 CSRF and CORS Protection
- Configure CSRF protection for form submissions
- Enhance CORS configuration for API endpoints
- Add HTTP security headers

## 2. DTO Layer Implementation

### 2.1 Core DTO Classes
- Create DTOs for all entity classes (UserDTO, FlightSearchDTO, etc.)
- Implement conversion utilities between entities and DTOs

### 2.2 Request/Response DTOs
- Design specialized request DTOs for user registration and login
- Create response DTOs with only necessary fields for client consumption
- Add validation annotations to DTOs

### 2.3 Mapper Classes
- Implement mapper classes using ModelMapper or MapStruct
- Create bidirectional mapping methods for each entity-DTO pair
- Add configuration for handling complex nested mappings

### 2.4 Controller Refactoring
- Refactor controllers to use DTOs instead of entities in request/response
- Update endpoint documentation with new DTO structures
- Add response wrapper classes for standardized API responses

## 3. Validation Implementation

### 3.1 Input Validation
- Add bean validation annotations to DTOs (@NotNull, @Size, etc.)
- Create custom validation annotations for complex business rules
- Implement validators for domain-specific validations

### 3.2 Service Layer Validation
- Add pre-condition checks in service methods
- Ensure referential integrity before database operations
- Implement business rule validation

### 3.3 Controller Validation
- Configure global validation using @Valid annotation
- Return appropriate validation error responses
- Standardize validation error format

### 3.4 Cross-Field Validation
- Implement complex validations spanning multiple fields
- Create validation groups for different contexts
- Add sequence-based validation for multi-step processes

## 4. Exception Handling Implementation

### 4.1 Custom Exceptions
- Create hierarchy of custom exceptions (ResourceNotFoundException, ValidationException, etc.)
- Map database-specific exceptions to custom exceptions
- Add contextual information to exceptions

### 4.2 Global Exception Handler
- Implement `@ControllerAdvice` based global exception handler
- Create exception handling methods for different exception types
- Configure unified error response format

### 4.3 Logging
- Add logging for all exceptions with appropriate levels
- Configure MDC (Mapped Diagnostic Context) for request tracing
- Implement log sanitization for sensitive data

### 4.4 Error Responses
- Design standardized error response format with error code, message, and details
- Add support for internationalization of error messages
- Include request identifiers in responses for support purposes

## 5. UI Integration

### 5.1 User Management UI
- Design and implement user registration page
- Create login/logout functionality
- Add user profile management screens

### 5.2 Flight Search History
- Implement UI for viewing search history
- Add filters and sorting for search history
- Create visualizations for common search patterns

### 5.3 Saved Flights UI
- Design interface for saving and viewing favorite flights
- Add functionality to compare saved flights
- Implement notifications for price changes

### 5.4 Booking Management
- Create booking workflow in UI
- Implement booking summary and confirmation screens
- Add booking history and status views

### 5.5 Admin Dashboard
- Design admin interface for user management
- Add analytics dashboard for flight search trends
- Implement audit log viewer
